## Overview
This repository contains reproducible codes for the proposed adversarial_seizure_detection model.  
In this paper, we propose a novel and generic deep learning framework aiming at patient-independent epileptic seizure diagnosis. The proposed approach refines the seizure-specific representation by eliminating the inter-subject noise through adversarial training. Moreover, we involve the attention mechanism to learn the contribution of each EEG channel in the epileptic seizure detection, which empowers our method with great explainability. Please check our paper for more details on the algorithm.
